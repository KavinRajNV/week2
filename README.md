# Week 2 - E-Waste Classification (AICTE Internship)

## Project Title:
E-Waste Generation Classification using CNN

## Dataset:
Used the modified dataset provided by Edunet Foundation. It includes training, validation, and test folders, each with 10 categories of e-waste images.

## Work Done in Week 2:

- Implemented image data augmentation techniques to improve the model's generalization.
- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Trained the model for 10 epochs with validation monitoring.
- Evaluated model performance using a confusion matrix.
- Tested the model using a custom uploaded image and observed the prediction results.
- Saved the trained model for future use.
